        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>I am 54 year old engineer by training, have worked in the energy business for all of my career thus far, with
            a high-tech slant. Currently I am working on computer vision for remote industrialized locations where 24/7
            supervision is often not possible or is very expensive. The thought is that with AI and computer vision,
            many routine supervisory monitoring tasks can be automated.
            <br>
            Originally, I am from Puerto La Cruz, Venezuela, and moved every four years or so growing up, living in
            Spain, Miami, San Juan, and then finally ending up in Denver when I started High School. I went to a college
            in-state, but then went about travels again, moving first to South America and later to Europe before
            finally returning back to Denver in 2016.
